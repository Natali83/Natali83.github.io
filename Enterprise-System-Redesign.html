            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <div class="box-text">
				<p>This project focused on the redesign of Galicia Bank’s Business Online Banking platform, a <strong>core enterprise system</strong> used by companies to manage financial operations in a <strong>highly regulated, high-stakes environment.</strong></p>
				<p>The platform supported <strong>multiple business roles with different permissions and access levels,</strong> where clarity, trust, and correctness were critical. Errors or misunderstandings could directly impact users’ finances, making this a system where <strong>design decisions carried real consequences.</strong></p>
				<p>This was not a visual refresh. It was a <strong>foundational system redesign</strong> aimed at improving autonomy, reducing operational overhead, and enabling the platform to scale.</p>

        </div>
         <div class="paragraph-block">
            <h2>Context & Challenge</h2>
            <div class="box-text">
				<p>The platform faced several structural challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A legacy interface that had remained largely unchanged for years</li>
                    <li>A migration from ASP.NET to .NET, introducing technical constraints and dependencies</li>
                    <li>Inconsistent information architecture that made tasks hard to complete</li>
                    <li>Heavy reliance on call centers and marketing teams to compensate for usability gaps</li>
					<li>No unified design system to support consistency or long-term scalability</li>
                </ul>
				<p>At the same time, the platform needed to support different business users—administrators, operators, and decision-makers—each with distinct responsibilities, permissions, and visibility.</p>

            <div class="box-text">
                <h4 class="mt-4">User Problem</h4>
                <p>Business users struggled to manage their finances independently. Unclear structure and inconsistent patterns made it difficult to understand:</p>
                <ul>
					<li>where critical information lived</li>
					<li>what actions were available to them</li>
					<li>which operations they were authorized to perform</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This uncertainty increased friction, errors, and reliance on external support.</p>
				<h4 class="mt-4">Bussines Problem</h4>
				<p>The lack of clarity translated into:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>high call-center demand</li>
					<li>increased training and support costs</li>
					<li>missed opportunities to scale the platform’s financial management capabilities</li>
				</ul>

                <p><strong>Single designer</strong> responsible for UX, system logic, and documentation </p>
				<p><strong>Fixed launch deadline</strong> aligned with business objectives (8 months)</p>

				<p><strong>Concurrent design, development, and documentation</strong> required to support migration</p>

                    Redesigned and implemented a new visual design system, resulting in a cohesive brand identity and a 15% increase in user trust.
                </li>
                <li>

			<h1>Approach</h1>
            <h2 class="mt-5">Designing for roles, permissions, and trust</h2>
            <div class="box-text">
				<p>The redesign started by shifting focus from screens to system logic:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Defining role-based workflows and permission boundaries</li>
                        <li>Ensuring the right information and actions were visible to the right users</li>
                        <li>Designing interactions that reinforced privacy, control, and accountability</li>

				<p>Information was reorganized into a clear structure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary navigation</strong> for stable, system-wide access</li>
					<li><strong>Dynamic content areas</strong> eflecting context and role</li>
					<li><strong>Account-specific details</strong> surfaced without overwhelming the interface</li>
                </ul>

					<li>reduce ambiguity for engineering teams</li>
					<li>support reuse across the platform</li>

				</ul>
				<p>Atomic design principles guided the creation of flexible components that could adapt to different business scenarios without fragmentation.</p>
				<h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Documentation as a core deliverable</h4>
				<p>Documentation was treated as part of the system itself:</p>
				<ul>
                    <li>design rules and patterns were clearly specified</li>
					<li>engineers could implement confidently and consistently</li>
					<li>design and code evolved together, reducing rework and delivery risk</li>

            <p class="mb-3">After several months of designing, coding, and documenting, the big day finally arrived. Launch day was just the beginning of an exciting journey.
            </p>
            <p>I worked closely with two departments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Marketing:</strong> This team provided valuable data about our users, helping us make informed decisions. They served as the voice of our users, supplying research information such as surveys, online comments, and phone call feedback. They managed all user feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Development:</strong> We worked side by side to ensure the design was implemented correctly. The ongoing documentation provided developers with the necessary information to continue with the entire migration process.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box-text">
            <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">The Hit</h4>
            <h2>Within a week of the launch, our customer support team received numerous complaints from long-time users who felt overwhelmed by the new app. </h2>
            <p>We anticipated that this complete overhaul would be challenging for our users and expected they would need assistance. <strong>However, we were overwhelmed by the volume of complaints, which was a significant setback for us.</strong>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box-text">
            <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Addressing the Problem</h4>
            <p>Quick decisions had to be made. Our users' finances depend entirely on us, so to address the complaints, we decided to have the two systems coexist. This decision would give us the time to analyze and resolve the numerous issues expressed by users.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box-text">
            <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Learning from Mistakes</h4>
            <p class="mb-5">Step by step, we began releasing video tutorials on how to use the app. At that time, it was more common for users to rely on the call center to address all their issues. After a couple of months, we learned a few crucial things:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="mb-3">
                    <strong>Enviroment matters:</strong> In 2013, the bank adopted focus groups as the main technique for listening to the voice of the user. After the big "hit," we understood the relevance of seeking new methods or techniques that address real needs. We truly grasped the importance of testing our product in the most realistic environment possible. 
                </li>
                <li class="mb-3">
                    <strong>Finances. Evolving with Care:</strong> The application hadn't changed for many years, so it was crucial that each change came with an explanation to provide security and control to our users. While we initially allowed users to experiment with the new system, we realized that finances are a delicate issue and require a more controlled approach.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>What Users Say vs. What Users Do:</strong> We learned that what users say is not always what they do. We talked to users, showed them the new menu and link arrangements, and our selected users always agreed with us. However, in the real environment, with pressure, real needs, time constraints, and many years of seeing elements displayed in one way, it turned out to be a source of frustration for our users.

                <p>Context, users, behaviors—everything changes; nothing remains static. It's imperative to always stay close to the user's voice through listening, designing, and testing. Iteration is the best way to stay up-to-date with our users.</p>
