            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <div class="box-text">
				<p>This project focused on the redesign of Galicia Bank’s Business Online Banking platform, a <strong>core enterprise system</strong> used by companies to manage financial operations in a <strong>highly regulated, high-stakes environment.</strong></p>
				<p>The platform supported <strong>multiple business roles with different permissions and access levels,</strong> where clarity, trust, and correctness were critical. Errors or misunderstandings could directly impact users’ finances, making this a system where <strong>design decisions carried real consequences.</strong></p>
				<p>This was not a visual refresh. It was a <strong>foundational system redesign</strong> aimed at improving autonomy, reducing operational overhead, and enabling the platform to scale.</p>

            <h2>Context & Challenge</h2>
            <div class="box-text">
				<p>The platform faced several structural challenges:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A legacy interface that had remained largely unchanged for years</li>
                    <li>A migration from ASP.NET to .NET, introducing technical constraints and dependencies</li>
                    <li>Inconsistent information architecture that made tasks hard to complete</li>
                    <li>Heavy reliance on call centers and marketing teams to compensate for usability gaps</li>
					<li>No unified design system to support consistency or long-term scalability</li>
                </ul>
				<p>At the same time, the platform needed to support different business users—administrators, operators, and decision-makers—each with distinct responsibilities, permissions, and visibility.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-4">User Problem</h4>
                <p>Business users struggled to manage their finances independently. Unclear structure and inconsistent patterns made it difficult to understand:</p>
                <ul>
					<li>where critical information lived</li>
					<li>what actions were available to them</li>
					<li>which operations they were authorized to perform</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This uncertainty increased friction, errors, and reliance on external support.</p>
				<h4 class="mt-4">Bussines Problem</h4>
				<p>The lack of clarity translated into:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>high call-center demand</li>
					<li>increased training and support costs</li>
					<li>missed opportunities to scale the platform’s financial management capabilities</li>

			<h2>Approach</h2>
           <h4 class="mt-4">Designing for roles, permissions, and trust</h4>
            <div class="box-text">
				<p>The redesign started by shifting focus from screens to system logic:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Defining role-based workflows and permission boundaries</li>
                        <li>Ensuring the right information and actions were visible to the right users</li>
                        <li>Designing interactions that reinforced privacy, control, and accountability</li>
                    </ul>
            </div>
			<h4 class="mt-4">Information architecture as a foundation</h4>
            <div class="box-text">
				<p>Information was reorganized into a clear structure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary navigation</strong> for stable, system-wide access</li>
					<li><strong>Dynamic content areas</strong> eflecting context and role</li>
					<li><strong>Account-specific details</strong> surfaced without overwhelming the interface</li>
                </ul>
				<p>This structure aligned the platform with users’ mental models, especially under time pressure.</p>

			<h2>Designing Navigation as a System Decision (Not a UI Choice)</h2>
            <div class="box-text">
				<p>In this project, navigation was not treated as a visual problem, but as a structural system decision.</p>
				<p>The platform needed to support <strong>multiple business roles,</strong> each with different permissions, responsibilities, and usage frequency. The primary risk was not that users would “fail to find” an option, but that they would <strong>misunderstand which actions were available to them in a given context.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>Given the volume of functionality and the need to expose it without forcing deep, repetitive navigation paths, I evaluated multiple navigation approaches. We chose a <strong>mega menu</strong> not for aesthetic reasons, but because it allowed us to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Make the <strong>full system map</strong> visible at a glance</li>
					<li>Reduce cognitive load for frequent, repeat tasks</li>
					<li>Enable anticipation (“I know where things are before I search”)</li>
					<li>Maintain consistency across roles without duplicating structures</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This decision prioritized <strong>clarity and predictability over apparent simplicity</strong>, based on the understanding that in enterprise financial systems, <strong>hiding complexity often increases risk rather than reducing it.</strong>

			<h2>Encoding Rules, Roles, and Permissions into the Interface</h2>
            <div class="box-text">
				<p>One of the core challenges was translating <strong>business rules and permission models</strong> into behaviors that users could clearly understand through the interface.
				</p>
				<p>The system needed to communicate, at all times:
				</p>				
				<ul>
					<li>what each role could do</li>
					<li>which information was available</li>
					<li>when an action was not permitted — and why</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Rather than delegating this logic exclusively to the backend or relying on error messages, I focused on <strong>making system rules visible through the UI itself</strong>—using states, visual hierarchy, repeated patterns, and consistent micro-decisions.
				</p>
				<p>This approach required:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>designing <strong>role-specific flows</strong></li>
					<li>defining clear states for available, restricted, and contextual actions</li>
					<li>avoiding “surprises” during critical moments such as confirmations, submissions, and transfers</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The goal was not only to prevent errors, but to <strong>build trust</strong>, ensuring the system felt predictable, transparent, and under control—even in complex financial scenarios.

			<h2>Documentation as a Scaling Mechanism (Not a Deliverable)</h2>
            <div class="box-text">
				<p>
					Within a context of technological migration and tight timelines, documentation stopped being a final artifact and became an <strong>active part of the system.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					As the sole designer on the project, designing, documenting, and implementing happened in parallel. This required treating documentation as a <strong>tool for alignment and scalability,</strong> rather than a formality.
				</p>
				<p>Documentation enabled us to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>reduce ambiguity during implementation</li>
					<li>ensure consistency across modules developed at different times</li>
					<li>support system continuity beyond my direct involvement</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Rather than describing screens, the documentation captured:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>rules</li>
					<li>decisions</li>
					<li>reusable patterns</li>
					<li>system boundaries</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					This experience shaped a way of working I still use today: <strong>designing systems that can survive over time, across team changes, and under evolving business demands.</strong></p>

			<h2>Launch & Risk Management</h2>
			<p>Following launch, long-time users reported friction adapting to the new system. Given the sensitivity of financial operations, immediate decisions were required.</p>
            <p>To protect user trust:</p>
			 <ul>
				 <li>the legacy and new systems temporarily coexisted</li>
				 <li>changes were introduced progressively</li>
				 <li>tutorials and guidance supported user transition</li>
			 </ul>
			 <p>This approach prioritized <strong>financial safety and user confidence over design purity.</strong></p>
